A seminar paper I wrote in Fall 2010 analyzing MPEG-LA and its patent pool for H.264

It's extremely raw and needs a lot of work to get to a publishable state, but I'm no longer interested in academic publication. I do believe, however, that the research I did for this paper could useful to others and therefore am putting this out there under a Creative Commons Attribution Share-alike 3.0 license.

Pull requests are welcomed and encouraged. I'm not an expert on video codecs nor a lawyer, and the paper is nearly two years old so I'd appreciate comments and corrections.
